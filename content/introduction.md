# Benefits:
swmm-js is a web-centric platform for creating, managing, and sharing EPA-SWMM (Environmental Protection Agency Stormwater Management Model) files and projects. Benefits of running in the browser include:
- Translation of the interface to virtually any language.
- Running EPA-SWMM on Linux, iOS, Android and many other operating systems.
- Running EPA SWMM on tablets, cell phones, and display units.
- Easy access to web files.
- Setting up your own website to host your own files.

This is just a small list of the current applications of swmm-js. As I improve the environment, I'm excited to share more of the interesting benefits of utilizing a web-centric swmm.
